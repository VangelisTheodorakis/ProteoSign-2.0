# Proteomics Differential Expression analysis at the push of a button!

This is my thesis rewriting and tweaking the [ProteoSign] tool(http://bioinformatics.med.uoc.gr/ProteoSign/).
My goal is to increase its **speed**, its **accuracy**, make it **reproducible** using Docker for R and 
if there is enough time left, to make it even more **user-friendly** using NodeJS-Angular.
